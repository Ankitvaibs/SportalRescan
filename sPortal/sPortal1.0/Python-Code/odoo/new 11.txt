case1 : importing inv only data to inv only ,std,unified should work fine
import old version exported data of inv only into inv only migrated proj(scanned or not scanned shld work)
import old version exported data of inv only into std migrated proj(scanned or not scanned shld work)
import old version exported data of inv only into new unified project proj(scanned or not scanned) shld work

Case 2: IMport unified data to std and inv only project
import old version exported data of unified scanner scanned into inv only migrated proj(scanned or not scanned) shld not work)
import old version exported data of unified scanner_agent scanned into std migrated proj(scanned or not scanned) shld not work
import old version exported data of  unified agent scanned  into std migrated proj(scanned or not scanned) shld work
import old version exported data of  unified agent+scanner scanned  into std migrated proj(scanned or not scanned) shld work)

case 3: IMporting std project to migrated inv only and unified should work
